# Database Performance Monitoring Report
## Overview
This report provides a summary of the performance of the database over a specified time period. It includes metrics such as the number of queries executed, the time taken for each query, and the total time taken for all queries. The report also provides insights into the performance of the database by analyzing the queries and their execution times. 

The report is generated using the following steps:
1. Connect to the database using the appropriate credentials.
2. Retrieve the performance metrics for the specified time period from the database.
3. Analyze the performance metrics to identify any issues or bottlenecks.
4. Generate a report that summarizes the performance metrics and provides insights into the database performance. 
5. Export the report to a file or display it on a web page. 
6. Send the report to the relevant stakeholders for review and action.
7. Schedule the report to be generated periodically to ensure that the database performance is monitored and maintained.
8. Monitor the performance of the database over time and adjust the database configuration as needed to improve performance.

This report provides a valuable tool for identifying and addressing performance issues in the database. By regularly monitoring the performance of the database, organizations can ensure that the database is running efficiently and can provide a reliable and consistent service to their users.

## Metrics
The following metrics are included in the performance monitoring report:
- Number of queries executed: The number of queries executed in the specified time period.
- Time taken for each query: The time taken for each query to execute.
- Total time taken for all queries: The total time taken for all queries to execute.
- Average time taken for each query: The average time taken for each query to   
execute.
- Query execution time distribution: The distribution of query execution times.
- Query execution time histogram: The histogram of query execution times.
- Query execution time box plot: The box plot of query execution times.

## Analysis
The following analysis is performed on the performance metrics:
- Identify any queries that are taking longer than expected to execute.
- Identify any queries that are taking longer than expected to execute.
- Identify any queries that are taking longer than expected to execute.

## Conclusion
The performance monitoring report provides a valuable tool for identifying and addressing performance issues in the database. By regularly monitoring the performance of the database, organizations can ensure that the database is running efficiently and can provide a reliable and consistent service to their users.
